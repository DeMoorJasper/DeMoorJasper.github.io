        <h3>Recipes</h3>
        <p>We take pride in serving you fresh recipes on a regular basis.
            Our recipes <strong>adjust over the seasons</strong>, using only products that
            are growing in your garden at that very moment. We also try to
            include <strong>fresh spices of the moment</strong> or dry spices from earlier
            harvests. Happy cooking!</p>

        <h3>Seeds</h3>
        <p>Our seeds are all organically grown and harvested, <strong>no preservatives
            or pesticides</strong> were added. We encourage our users to harvest their
            own share every season and couple back to the organisation, to
            increase the amount of local sub breeds in our offer. Every seed
            you buy has a <strong>traceable origin</strong>, so you are in full control of your
            production cycle</p>
